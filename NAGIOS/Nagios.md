In this command I added my username and password also otherwise nagios will give you default username and password.

```
 podman run -d --name nagios -p 8095:80 --cap-add=NET_RAW -e NAGIOSADMIN_USER=reetu -e NAGIOSADMIN_PASSWORD=nagios docker.io/jasonrivers/nagios

**podman run:** It tells your computer to start running something in a container.

**-d:** It stands for "detached mode." This means that the container will run in the background, and you'll get your command prompt back.

**--name nagios:** This gives your container a name, in this case, "nagios." It's like giving it a label so you can refer to it easily.

**-p 8095:80:** This maps port 8095 on your computer to port 80 in the container. So, when you access port 8095 on your computer, it's like talking to port 80 in the container.

**--cap-add=NET_RAW:** This adds the capability to send and receive raw network packets. It's needed for certain network-related tasks.</br
